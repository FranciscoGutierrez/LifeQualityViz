    <p>
      In this evaluation we will ask you to explore the impact of things like
      traffic, safety, and air quality on the quality of life.
      Further, we want you to explore how people think about these factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will show you a visualisation of these factors in 6 cities in the US.
      We will then give you some tasks in which we will ask you to answer simple
      questions or to describe similarities and differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      But first, a brief tutorial.

        <p>
          On the left of the screen you can see the <b>different properties</b>
          that <b>determine quality of life and happiness</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can <b>activate</b> and <b>deactivate</b> them so that they will
          be considered (or) not in the prediction
          of the quality of life and happiness in all cities.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div style="display: flex; flex-direction:column; justify-content: flex-start; align-items: flex-start;">
      <p>
        In addition, you can <b>move the sliders</b> to change their <b>importance</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the weather is of <b>high importance</b> to you, set its slider to <b>100%</b>.</li>
        <li>If it is of <b>medium importance</b> to you, set it to <b>50%</b>.</li>
        <li>If it is of <b>low importance</b> to you, set it to <b>10%</b>.</li>
        <li>If it is <b>not important</b> to you, but you still want it to be considered in the prediction, set it to 0%, but keep the checkbox activated.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      By deactivating a property using the checkbox,
      it will be completely removed from the prediction.

      The visualisation shows you,
      how widely opinions differ regarding all active aspects.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A <b>wide spread</b> means that <b>opinions</b> are <b>very different.</b></li>
      <li>A <b>narrow spread</b> means that <b>opinions</b> are <b>rather similar.</b></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When you <b>change a property</b>, you will often see a
      <b>change regarding the predicted quality of life</b> or <b>happiness</b>
      in a city.
    </p>
    <img src="/tutorial/dots3.png" height="250px"/>
    <p>
      <b>But pay attention:</b> Sometimes, if you change the importance of a factor,
      <b>the quality of life may increase while the happiness decreases</b>.
      This means that the factor may contribute to a <b>high quality of life</b>,
      but that people have a <b>negative opinion of it</b>.

      The <b>thick horizontal grey line</b> shows you the trend between the aspects.
      It combines the mean value of happiness concerning both aspects.

      The vertical line shows you the mean <b>quality of life</b>.

        You can also read the happiness of people from the <b>black</b> number
        next to each face. The small <b>grey numbers</b>,
        <b>together with the height of the bar,</b> show you how widely
        <b>opinions differ.</b>

      <p>
        A <b>high bar</b> with a large range means that <b>opinions differ widely</b>.
        A <b>small bar</b> with a small range means <b>opinions are largely the same</b>.

        That’s it. Now we will give you some tasks to answer using the
        slider and the visualisation. After that we will ask you some questions.

        IMPORTANT: We know this test may not be easy. However,
        <b>we will pay you more money, the better you do</b>.
